### Overview
This repository is dedicated to the Applied Regression Analysis course I took 
during my undergraduate studies. In this course, I learned about the mathematics 
that is used to conduct Ordinary Least Squares regression, the assumptions
inherent to OLS regression, how to analyze the results of a model, and how to conduct
diagnositics of the model to ensure mathematical validity. 

You'll find some of the homework scripts and write-ups I completed while in the course. 
Enjoy!
